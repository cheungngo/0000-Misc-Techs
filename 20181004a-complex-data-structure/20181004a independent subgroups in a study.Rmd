###

Suppose we need to combine the results of two independent subgroups, e.g. treatment1 and treatment2 in a meta-analysis.  e.g. in the OCD-TMS study they did a three arm experiment where both 1Hz, 10Hz and sham has been included

###

### Looking at the data (YBOCS score)

###

### Constructing the functions

```{r}
m_ind_group = function (n1,n2,m1,m2) {
  (n1*m1+n2*m2)/(n1+n2)
}
```

###

```{r}
sd_ind_group = function(n1,n2,m1,m2,s1,s2) {
  sqrt(((n1-1)*s1^2+(n2-1)*s2^2+(n1*n2)/(n1+n2)*(m1-m2)^2)/(n1+n2-1))
}
```

###

### Calculation of the 'pre' combined (10Hz and 1Hz) score

```{r}
pre_m = m_ind_group(15,15,26.7,25.3)
pre_sd = sd_ind_group(15,15,26.7,25.3,6.5,4.7)
print(c(pre_m,pre_sd))
```

###

### Calculation of the 'post' (0 months) combined (10Hz and 1Hz) score

```{r}
post_m = m_ind_group(15,15,14.7,18.5)
post_sd = sd_ind_group(15,15,14.7,18.5,5.9,8.5)
print(c(post_m,post_sd))
```

### The rest would be left to the second part: difference of outcome within study
