Amlodipine,DB00381,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00381,"Amlodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that DHP CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediate contraction; however, some studies have indicated that amlodipine also binds to and inhibits N-type calcium channels (see references in Targets section). Similar to other DHP CCBs, amlodipine binds directly to inactive L-type calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives amlodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, amlodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells."
Bioallethrin,DB13746,"approved, experimental",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB13746,"Bioallethrin, like other pyrethroids, binds to voltage gated sodium channels in their closed state and modifies the gating kinetics [1]. Channel opening appears to increase affinity of the channel for pyrethroids like bioallethrin. Once bound pyrethroids slow both the opening and closing of the sodium channel resulting in a need for stronger excitatory potentials to produce an action potential and a delay in repolarization. The these changes make the neuron more susceptible to large action potentials and repeated firing by both increasing the initial threshold and reducing the input needed for after-potentials. When repeated firing does occur, the nerve terminal will release more neurotransmitter which can produce muscle paralysis through tetanus. This paralysis stops the breathing of lice and scabies parasites resulting in death."
Gabapentin,DB00996,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00996,"Some pyrethroids act on calcium channels to increase intracelllular calcium [2]. Bioallethrin produces a very small increase in intracellular calcium in mouse neocortical neurons by acting on N-type calcium channels but the effect returns to baseline within 2 min. In contrast bioallethrin has been found to block L T, and P/Q-types of voltage gated calcium channels in human embryonic kidney cell cultures [6]. Bioallethrin has been found to inhibit both sodium-calcium dependent and magnesium-calcium ATP hydrolysis in insects although it, along with other type I pyrethroids, has a greater effect on sodium-calcium dependent hydrolysis [3]. Bioallethrin may stimulate phosphoinositol breakdown in synaptoneuromes as other type I pyrethroids have been observed to do so [4]. Other type I pyrethoids have also been found to bind to kainate receptors [5]. "
Gabapentin enacarbil,DB08872,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB08872,"Gabapentin, an analog of GABA, is used as an anticonvulsant to treat partial seizures, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and painful neuropathies. Potential uses include monotherapy of refractory partial seizure disorders, and treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis, tremor. mood disorders, and attenuation of disruptive behaviors in dementia. Gabapentin has high lipid solubility, is not metabolized by the liver, has no protein binding, and doesn't possess the usual drug interactions."
Felodipine,DB01023,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01023,"Since gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin, it's physiological effects are the same as gabapentin. Concerning PHN, gabapentin prevents allodynia and hyperalgesia."
Isradipine,DB00270,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00270,"Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor. Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells."
Nitrendipine,DB01054,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01054,"Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of isradipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. "
Amiodarone,DB01118,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01118,"By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
Bepridil,DB01244,"approved, withdrawn",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01244,"Amiodarone belongs to a class of drugs called Vaughan-Williams Class III antiarrhythmic agents. It is used in the treatment of a wide range of cardiac tachyarhthmias, including both ventricular and supraventricular (atrial) arrhythmias. After intravenous administration in man, amiodarone relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reduces peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and slightly increases cardiac index. Amiodarone prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential. It has numerous other effects however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects."
Ibutilide,DB00308,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00308,"Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. Bepridil inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil. In cardiac myocytes in vitro, bepridil was shown to be tightly bound to actin. Bepridil regularly reduces heart rate and arterial pressure at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works."
Mibefradil,DB01388,"investigational, withdrawn",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01388,"Ibutilide prolongs the action potential duration and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo, i.e., class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that ibutilide, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act."
Magnesium sulfate,DB00653,"approved, investigational, vet_approved",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00653,"Mibefradil is a tetralol calcium channel blocking agent that inhibits the influx of calcium ions across both the T (low-voltage) and L (high-voltage) calcium channels of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, with a greater selectivity for T channels. Vasodilation occurs in vascular smooth muscle, causing a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a resulting decrease in blood pressure. Mibefradil causes a slight increase in cardiac output during chronic dosing. Mibefradil slows sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction, producing a slight reduction in heart rate and a slight increase in the PR interval. It has also been shown to slightly lengthen the corrected sinus node recovery time and AH interval and to raise the Wenckebach point. The mechanism by which mibefradil reduces angina is not known, but is thought to be attributed to a reduction in heart rate, total peripheral resistance (afterload), and the heart rate–systolic blood pressure product at any given level of exercise. The result of these effects is a decrease in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen demand."
Verapamil,DB00661,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00661,"Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker that also has antiarrythmic activity. The R-enantiomer is more effective at reducing blood pressure compared to the S-enantiomer. However, the S-enantiomer is 20 times more potent than the R-enantiomer at prolonging the PR interval in treating arrhythmias."
Dronedarone,DB04855,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB04855,"Dronedarone is a non-iodinated benzofuran derivative for the management of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone inhibits human atrial sodium currents (INa) in a dose dependent manner in which a concentration of 0.3 μM is sufficient to completely inhibit INa. Chemically it is related to amiodarone, a popular antiarrhythmic the use of which is limited to toxicity due its high iodine content (pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid disease) as well as by liver disease. Dronedarone lacks the iodine, and is expected to have less toxicity, yet it displays amiodarone-like class III antiarrhytmic activity in vitro and in clinical trials. Despite this advantage over amiodarone, clinical trials of dronedarone have shown that it may increase risk of stroke and mortality from cardiovascular causes and arrhythmia. Furthermore, amiodarone more potently effects action potential and refractory periods than dronedarone. "
Nimodipine,DB00393,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00393,"Nimodipine belongs to the class of pharmacological agents known as calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine is indicated for the improvement of neurological outcome by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured congenital aneurysms who are in good neurological condition post-ictus (e.g., Hunt and Hess Grades I-III). The contractile processes of smooth muscle cells are dependent upon calcium ions, which enter these cells during depolarization as slow ionic transmembrane currents. Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle. In animal experiments, nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. "
Ethanol,DB00898,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898,"Alcohol produces injury to cells by dehydration and precipitation of the cytoplasm or protoplasm. This accounts for its bacteriocidal and antifungal action. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Ninety to 98% of ethanol that enters the body is completely oxidized. Ethanol is also used as a cosolvent to dissolve many insoluble drugs and to serve as a mild sedative in some medicinal formulations. Ethanol also binds to GABA, glycine, NMDA receptors and modulates their effects. Ethanol is also metabolised by the hepatic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase."
Azelnidipine,DB09230,investigational,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09230,"Azelnidipine inhibits trans-membrane Ca2+ influx through the voltage-dependent channels of smooth muscles in vascular walls. Ca2+ channels are classified into various categories, including L-type, T-type, N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca2+ channels. The L-type Ca2+ channels [6]. Normally, calcium induces smooth muscle contraction, contributing to hypertension. When calcium channels are blocked, the vascular smooth muscle does not contract, resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle walls and decreased blood pressure."
Nifedipine,DB01115,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01115,"Nifedipine, the prototype of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), is similar to other dihydropyridines including amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nicardipine. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, nifedipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives nifedipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, nifedipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells. By blocking the calcium channels, Nifedipine inhibits the spasm of the coronary artery and dilates the systemic arteries, results in a increase of myocardial oxygen supply and a decrease in systemic blood pressure."
Nisoldipine,DB00401,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00401,"Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nisoldipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."

Cyclandelate,DB04838,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB04838,Cyclandelate produces peripheral vasodilation by a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. Pharmacological action may be due to calcium-channel antagonism.
Diltiazem,DB00343,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00343,"Diltiazem, a benzothiazepine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Diltiazem is a non-dihydropyridine (DHP)member of the calcium channel blocker class, along with Verapamil. Diltiazem is similar to other peripheral vasodilators.

Contulakin-G,DB05950,investigational,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05950,"The exact mechanism of action is still being investigated for all of the potential indications of agmatine. Some of the biochemical mechanisms discovered so far concern agmatine's indication for diabetes, neuroprotection, and psychiatric conditions. In diabetes, agmatine produces hypoglycemia by increasing the release of insulin form pancreatic islet cells and increasing glucose uptake by the cells through increased endorphin release from the adrenal glands. Concerning neuroprotection, agmatine's effects are thought to involve modulation of receptors (NMDA, alpha 2, and imidazoline) and ion channels (ATP sensitive potassium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels) as well as blocking nitric oxide synthesis. Agmatine blocks nitric oxide synthesis by reducing the nitric oxide synthase -2 (NOS-2) protein in astroglial cells and macrophages. With respect to agmatine's benefit in psychiatric disorders, it is suggested that the mechanism involves neurotransmitter receptor modulation of the NMDA, alpha-2, serotonin, opioid, and imidazoline receptors. Specifically when agmatine binds to the imidazoline and alpha 2 receptors, it acts as a neurotransmitter and releases catecholamines from the adrenal gland. "
Levetiracetam,DB01202,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01202,"Seletracetam binds to SV2A in a stereospecific and selective manner. SV2A is a membrane glycoprotein present in synaptic vesicles of neurons that plays a role as calcium regulators in neurotransmitter release and modulate synaptic networks. Seletracetam is thought to reduce excessive neuronal activity by modulating SV2A function and restoring the ability of a neuron to regulate its neurotransmitter release.
Seizure generation induces a sustained membrane depolarization causing a prolonged firing of voltage-dependent calcium currents sufficient to induce a significant rise in calcium concentration. High voltage-activated calcium currents are inhibited by seletracetam by blocking N-type calcium channels in the pyramidal neurons. The drug reduces the degree of calcium influx and decreases the intraneuronal calcium concentration, blocking the abnormal fluctuations in membrane potential occurring during epileptic discharges."
Agmatine,DB08838,"experimental, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB08838,"Benidipine is a tripe calcium channel inhibitor by inhibiting L, N and T type calcium channel.[4] It presents a very long-lasting activity that can be explained by its high affinity for cell membranes from the DHP binding site; this characteristic indicated a long-lasting pharmacological activity of benidipine. The additional property of benidipine is the vascular selectivity towards peripheral blood vessels.[2]"
Seletracetam,DB05885,investigational,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05885,"Cilnidipine acts on the L-type calcium channels of blood vessels by blocking the incoming calcium and suppressing the contraction of blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. Cilnidipine also works on the N-type calcium channel located at the end of the sympathetic nerve, inhibiting the emission of norepinephrine and suppressing the increase in stress blood pressure.[2]"
Benidipine,DB09231,experimental,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09231,Increases plasma calcium levels leading to a decrease in calcium flux and increase in calcium deposition into bone [3]
Cilnidipine,DB09232,investigational,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09232,"The phosphate ions in calcium phosphate likely react with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to neutralize the pH. In toothpaste and in systemic circulation, calcium phosphate provides a source of calcium and phosphate ions to support remineralization of the teeth and bone homeostasis respectively. The increase in plasma calcium reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [2]. Calcium does this by stimulating a G-protein coupled calcium receptor on the surface of parathyroid cells. The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys. Another hormone, calitonin, is likely involved in the reduction of bone resorption during periods of high plasma calcium."
Calcium Citrate,DB11093,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11093,"Calcium phosphate reacts with acid in the stomach to raise the pH [3].

Calcium Phosphate,DB11348,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11348,"Trimebutine is a spasmolytic agent that acts directly on smooth muscle to modulate gastric motility. It shows a ""dual function"" that stimulates or inhibits spontaneous contractions depending on the concentration and prior contractile activity in the preparation. Targeting ion conductance that regulates GI motility, trimebutine inhibits the inward calcium currents and calcium-dependent potassium currents in a concentration-dependent manner [2]. At lower concentrations (1-10uM), trimebutine depolarizes the resting membrane potential without affecting the amplitude of contractions, which is thought to be mediated by inhibition of outward potassium currents. It is also shown to activate T-type Ca2+ channel and increase gastric emptying, intestinal and colonic contractility [1]. At higher concentrations (100-300uM), reduced amplitude of spontaneous contractions and action potentials is thought to be mediated by inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels and inward calcium current [2]. Trimebutine mediates a local anesthetic action by acting as a weak agonist at mu opioid receptors."
Calcium phosphate dihydrate,DB14481,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB14481,"Contraction of vascular smooth muscle is stimulated by Gq coupled receptors which produce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by opening of voltage dependent calcium channels and an influx of calcium into the cell ultimately producing contraction. Manidipine binds to and dissociates slowly from L- and T-type voltage dependent calcium channels on smooth muscle cells, blocking the entrance of extracellular calcium into the cell and preventing this contraction [1, 2]. This produces vasodilation which decreases blood pressure. Manidipine produces renal vasodilation and an increase in natriuresis. This likely contributes to the antihypertensive effect by reducing blood volume. Manidipine is selective for the vasculature and does not produce significant effects on the heart or central nervous system at clinically relevant dosages."
Trimebutine,DB09089,approved,https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09089,"By blocking the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels, it prevents the transmembrane calcium influx [2]. Normally, calcium ions serve as intracellular messengers or activators in exictable cells including vascular smooth muscles. The influx of calcium ultimately causes the excitation and depolarization of the tissues. Lacidipine inhibits the contractile function in the vascular smooth muscle and reduce blood pressure. Due to its high membrane partition coefficient, some studies suggest that lacidipine may reach the receptor via a two-step process; it first binds and accumulates in the membrane lipid bilayer and then diffuses within the membrane to the calcium channel receptor [5]. It is proposed that lacidipine preferentially blocks the inactivated state of the calcium channel [5]."
Manidipine,DB09238,"approved, investigational",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09238,"Through its antioxidant properties shared amongst other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, lacidipine demonstrates an additional clinical benefit. Its antiatherosclerotic effects are mediated by suppressing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent inflammatory actions by chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules, thus reducing atherosclerotic lesion formation [4]. Lacidipine may also suppress cell proliferation and migration in smooth muscle cells and suppress the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which affects the stability of atheromatous plaques [4].

Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [Label]."

Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [5]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [5]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [5]."
